def reconstructed_image(D,c,num_coeffs,X_mean,n_blocks,im_num):
    '''
    This function reconstructs an image X_recon_img given the number of
    coefficients for each image specified by num_coeffs
    '''
    
    '''
        Parameters
    ---------------
    c: np.ndarray
        a n x m matrix  representing the coefficients of all the image blocks.
        n represents the maximum dimension of the PCA space.
        m is (number of images x n_blocks**2)

    D: np.ndarray
        an N x n matrix representing the basis vectors of the PCA space
        N is the dimension of the original space (number of pixels in a block)

    im_num: Integer
        index of the image to visualize

    X_mean: np.ndarray
        a matrix representing the mean block.

    num_coeffs: Integer
        an integer that specifies the number of top components to be
        considered while reconstructing
        

    n_blocks: Integer
        number of blocks comprising the image in each direction.
        For example, for a 256x256 image divided into 64x64 blocks, n_blocks will be 4
    '''
    
    c_im = c[:num_coeffs,n_blocks*n_blocks*im_num:n_blocks*n_blocks*(im_num+1)]

    return X_recon_img

def plot_reconstructions(D,c,num_coeff_array,X_mean,n_blocks,im_num):
    '''
    Plots 9 reconstructions of a particular image using D as the basis matrix and coeffiecient
    vectors from c

    Parameters
    ------------------------
        num_coeff_array: Iterable
            an iterable with 9 elements representing the number of coefficients
            to use for reconstruction for each of the 9 plots
        
        c: np.ndarray
            a l x m matrix  representing the coefficients of all blocks in a particular image
            l represents the dimension of the PCA space used for reconstruction
            m represents the number of blocks in an image

        D: np.ndarray
            an N x l matrix representing l basis vectors of the PCA space
            N is the dimension of the original space (number of pixels in a block)

        n_blocks: Integer
            number of blocks comprising the image in each direction.
            For example, for a 256x256 image divided into 64x64 blocks, n_blocks will be 4

        X_mean: basis vectors represent the divergence from the mean so this
            matrix should be added to all reconstructed blocks

        im_num: Integer
            index of the image to visualize
    '''

    Each basis vector represents an image block of shape (sz, sz)

    Parameters
    -------------
    D: np.ndarray
        N x n matrix representing the basis vectors of the PCA space
        N is the dimension of the original space (number of pixels in a block)
        n represents the maximum dimension of the PCA space (assumed to be atleast 16)
